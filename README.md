 Batman wiki Page â€“ HTML Website

## Project Overview
My first HTML website for my foundations in computing course. I used mostly HTML and added CSS for the font style and colour. I used the src attribute to improve search engine optimisation and accessibility. You can see how much I've
improved from here in [this project](https://github.com/KallamSamad/flexproj) on UI and for JS components of a webpage and manipulating DOM, [here](https://github.com/KallamSamad/Rock-Paper-Scissors)

## Project pros:
