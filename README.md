 Batman wiki Page â€“ HTML Website

## Project Overview
My first HTML website for my foundations in computing course. I used mostly HTML and added CSS for the font style and colour. I used the src attribute to improve search engine optimisation and accessibility.  

##Project pros: 
- I used HTML effectively to create character bios of famous Batman characters
- The website has a good design for a start
##Project cons: 
-I could've improved the website by making the website more interactive. 
-I could've used JavaScript to add buttons and output alerts to make the website more interactive. 
-The website isn't fully complete and has broken images
-I could've improved the format furhter by using bootstrap 

## Features
- Character Bios: Detailed information about Batman and his allies.
- Gallery: A collection of Batman-related images.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For the page structure and content.
- CSS: For styling and layout.
