    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <blockquote>I believe whatever doesn’t kill you simply makes you… <b>stranger</b>.</blockquote>
    <p>The Joker. A ruthless criminal mastermind who always wears a purple suit, has green hair, and wears make up -  and who could forget that infamous and menacing smile? The truth is, he is anything but funny. He has a disturbingly twisted sense of humor using irony and sarcasm to mix with his madness making party themed traps and weapons.The Joker's past is unknown. Altough some people say that he was a failed comedian named <b>Arthur Fleck</b> but most say that this is a rumour. He has no superpowers, however, his real strength is to create destruction acting out of impulse with no real plan other than anarchy in its purest form. This sporadic choas is what makes him one of Gotham’s most unpredictable and dangerous villains. </p>
