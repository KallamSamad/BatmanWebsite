    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <blockquote>Ah, you think <b>darkness</b> is your ally. But you merely <b>adopted</b> the dark; I was <b>born</b> in it, <b>molded</b> by it. I didn’t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but <b>blinding!</b></blockquote>
    <p>Bane is a powerful combination of brains and brawns. Raised in a harsh South American prison environment as a child, he conditions his body and mind to perfection, mastering both combat and intellectual tactics. He is a strategic genius - even finding out Batman's identity. Bane is notorious for his use of the super-steroid Venom, which increases his already extraordinary strength to monstrous levels. Despite this makes him drunk with power and that he loses his cognitive abilities, he forgets that Batman's identity but becomes a pure brute. This venom increases his muscle mass to extraordinary proportions. Truly a force to be reckoned with.</p>
