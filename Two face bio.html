        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <blockquote>You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.</blockquote>
        <p>Everything was good for Harvey Dent. He was Gotham’s district attorney and had sworn an oath to keep the city safe, known as the "white knight". But everything changed when his heart was broken in consequence to the evildoings of Joker. Both Harvey and the love of his life, Rachel, were kidnapped by the Joker and placed in separate locations surrounded by canistors attached to explosives. It was impossible for Batman to get to there in time to save both of them. Batman had a horrifying dilemma, because Rachel was his childhood best friend and Dent was the hope for the city. Only one person could be saved. Batman chose the city - he saved Harvey. As soon as Harvey was about to be saved a fire broke out from the fuel canisters and Dent's face was scarred from this, as well as his heart.

            He woke up in the hospital to see none other than the very man who caused his pain - the Joker. Adding to the psychological damage inflicted on Dent, the Joker manipulated him. He gave Dent a revolver and a coin and uttered <i>"chaos is fair"</i> convincing Dent that the law had failed him, that it had cost Rachel her life. 
            Dent flipped a coin to decided the Joker's fate and didn't shoot. Joker's plan worked because if Harvey wasn't willing to kill the very man who was responsible for his loss, nobody was safe.
        From that moment, the White Knight of Gotham was gone. A more vengeful and ruthless villain known as Two-Face then emerged.His heart was consumed by anger and hate. He experienced a deep cognitive dissonance between the man he once was and the criminal he became. To justify his evil, Two-Face used a coin — an unbiased, 50/50 chance to decide who gets to live and die.</p>
